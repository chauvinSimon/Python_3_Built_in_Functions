useful functions and scripts for everyday coding in Python

## Mutli_Process_Real_Time_Plot
Script to **update a plot** of data coming from **two different sources** at a high rate.

Implementation of Python **multiprocessing** with a **Queue** (Queues are thread and process safe):
- two `producers` add new entries to the Queue
- one `consumer` updates the plot figure

## Python_3_Built_in_Functions

More a draft than a project.
The idea was for me to get familiar with the Python built-in functions, implementing examples for each of them.

Lists of functions:
-    https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html
-    https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_functions.asp
-    https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/
-    http://www.trytoprogram.com/python-programming/python-built-in-functions/

Future work
-    implement examples for the terminology of https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html
