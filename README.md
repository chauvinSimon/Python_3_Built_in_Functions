# Python_3_Built_in_Functions

More a draft than a project.
The idea is for me to get familiar with the Python built-in functions.

Lists of functions:
-    https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html
-    https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_functions.asp
-    https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/
-    http://www.trytoprogram.com/python-programming/python-built-in-functions/


Future work

-    implement examples for the terminology of https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html
